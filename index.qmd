## What does it come from?

Processed leaves from the *Ilex paraguariensis* evergreen shrub-tree

They are trimmed by hand, dried, ground, and then aged in a controlled
environment for up to 24 months

## An Indigenous tradition

::: incremental
-   Originally harvested and consumed by the Guaraní people in
    present-day Paraguay
-   Its group consumption originates from Guaraní celebrations in honor
    of Tupâ, the god of rain and water
-   Other Indigenous people consumed mate including the Charrúa in
    Uruguay and Tupí in Brazil
:::

::: notes
-   The Guaraní people call it "ka'a" (herb)
-   The Tupí people called it "what keeps us alive"
:::

## Etymology

The word "Maté" comes from the Quechua "Mati" which means "container for
a drink"

. . .

::: callout-note
Maté is not the tea but the vessel! <br> Although it's most common to
say you're *"drinking matè"*, this is only for brevity.

## A tool of Spanish empire

> The history of mate is a case study of how American plants were turned
> into commodities to strengthen European rule over Indigenous peoples
> rather than to foster their autonomy and independence.

---*Sarreal, Julia. The Guaraní and their missions: a socioeconomic
history. Stanford University Press, 2014*

## A tool of Spanish empire

::: incremental
-   Mate seeds have extremely hard shells and are very difficult to
    germinate.
-   Drawing on Guaraní knowledge and labor, the missions became the
    first site to domesticate the plant
-   By the 17th century, it had become the chief export of the Guaraní
    territories, above sugar, wine and tobacco
:::

::: notes
-   Maté was therefore turned into a "tool of empire" that connected
    regions, acculturated Guaraní people, and funded the colonial
    government.

Mainly, other caffeneited drinks were already popular in Europe and the
difficulties in domesticating and transplanting maté made them say no
thanks

to this day, the social rituals associated with drinking mate----sharing
one same vessel and straw----aren't accepted everywhere.
:::

## Green gold

-   After the Jesuits were expelled, the maté plantations were abandoned
    and maté was harvested in the wild again
-   Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay were competing to dominate the trade
-   Some of the areas where maté grew wild were the object of
    territorial disputes among them

## Maté wars

-   These disputes led to the breakout of the **Triple Alliance War**
    (1864--1870) that turned Brazil and Argentina against Paraguay.
-   By the end of the war, Brazil annexed large mate-producing areas and
    dethroned Paraguay as the world's top producer.

## Brazil changes its mind

-   By the 1930s, Brazil was more focused on developing their coffee
    exports
-   Argentina, which had long been the largest consumer, finally became
    the largest producer.

## Maté today

::: incremental
-   Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay produce 1.4 million tons per year,
    but **less than 5% is exported**

-   Argentina is currently the largest producer and overall consumer

-   **But** Uruguayans drink twice as much per capita (22 lb per year!!)

## How to prepare (cebar) maté

::: incremental
-   Fill the máte up to three-quarters full with dry herb and shake off
    any powder
-   Pour **a little** lukewarm water on one side
-   Boil water to 78 °C
-   Insert your straw or *bombilla* on the edge of the wet herbs
-   Pour water directly onto the straw, keeping one side as dry as
    possible
:::

## Other ways

::: incremental
-   In Paraguay, it is more common to drink with cold water (tereré)
-   Some people put sugar on it and even oranges. Go wild.
:::

## Maté standards

::: incremental
-   Everyone drinks from the same maté and straw
    ( [*bombilla*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombilla "Bombilla") ).
-   The maté is given by the brewer (el cebador) to each person, often
    in a circle, in turns.
-   The recipient drinks the few mouthfuls in the container, and then
    returns the mate to the brewer
-   The brewer then refills it and passes it to the next person in
    clockwise order.
:::

::: notes
-   Drinking mate is often a communal ritual following customary rules.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-important
The recipient is not supposed to give thanks until the maté is
completely done, otherwise you might not be served any more *mates*.
:::

. . .

::: callout-important
It is considered rude to move the straw around
:::

. . .

::: callout-tip
It's totally acceptable to slurp the mate at the end of your turn. It's
actually a sign of respect and letting everyone know you're done.
:::

::: notes
So wrapping up, my whole motivation for giving this talk was to convince
you we should adopt a mate team standard that's at least as rigorous as
Argentina's
